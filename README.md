# SIGNAL_GENERATOR_DSP
## This simple generator is able to determinate the value of the next samples of harmonic, triangular, square, random signals with uniform and normal distribution.
### The code contains functions that return the values of consecutive samples based on frequency, amplitude, sample number and padding (in the case of a square wave signal)
